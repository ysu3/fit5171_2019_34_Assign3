,Zuma (USA-280)[16],Unnamed U.S. government agency,Low Earth,Classified,8 January,"Launch success, satellite status classified"
,"There were unconfirmed reports that the Zuma satellite failed to separate from the second stage due to an issue with the payload adapter provided by Northrop Grumman, who also manufactured the satellite.[13] However, given the classified nature of the mission, there may not be confirmation until declassification. SpaceX and the United States Air Force reviewed the Falcon 9 flight data and saw no issues with the launch vehicle itself that would effect future launches.[14][15]",,,,,
